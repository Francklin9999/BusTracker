# Real-Time Bus Tracking App

This project is a real-time bus tracking application that provides live data for Montreal's public transport system, including buses, metro, and trains. Using WebSockets, it displays the real-time positions of buses on an interactive Google Map, enabling users to see which buses are arriving based on their current location. With features like interactive mapping through the Google Maps API, users can create their itineraries seamlessly and receive location-based alerts to help plan their journeys effectively.
